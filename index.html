    <h2>Who is Allie?</h2>
    <p>Allie is a girl from Johns Creek, GA.
       She will be attending Johns Creek High
       School as a senior this upcoming school
       year. In her free time she does many things
       like playing and reffing lacross, working
       at Chick Fil A. Allie will not be found
       shopping but instead posting on her rant
       blog on Weebly (look below). In her future, Allie plans
       to major in Computer Science with a minor
       in International Studies to prepare for her
       dream job. What is that dream job? Allie
       wants to work for the CIA on a task force.
       Even knowing only a few facts about Allie,
       it can easily be known that she is a strong,
       unique woman who has all the charecteristics
       of a leader.</p>
